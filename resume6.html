          Howsit, at the moment, I'm living in Cape Town and learning to code. I
          am currently looking to change career paths and looking forward to the
          new learning curve. Once complete, I'm looking to go overseas again.
          This is my first project submission for CodeSpace Academy.

                During lockdown in 2020, I decided to start learning how to
                code. After speaking to a few friends in the industry, I began
                working on

                Responsive Web Design certification. Just like that, I caught
                the coding bug. A year later, I have decided to further my
                studies with CodeSpace and the Software Development Course that
                they offer.

                Fresh out of school, I spent my first two years studying
                full-time. While studying, I worked part-time as a delivery
                driver during the week and on weekends at Chelsea Cleaning,
                running the office. During my second year, I switched to
                studying part-time and working full-time. I was now in a more
                senior position. I was now able to put what I had learnt into
                practice.
