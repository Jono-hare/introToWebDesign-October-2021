              During lockdown in 2020 I decided to start learning how to code. After speakng to a few friend in the industry I began working on <a class="h3-links" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jono-hare/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp's</a> Responisve Web Design certification. This was my first taste of the coding bug. Now, a year later, I have decided to further my studies with CodeSpace and their Software Development Course that they offer.

              Fresh out of school I spent my first two years studying fulltime. While studying I was working part time as a delivery driver during the week and on weekends at Chelsea Cleaning running the office. During my second year, I switched to studying parttime and working full time at Chelsea Cleaning. This was where I was able to put what I was learning into a practical environment.
